                    <p1>Welcome to Belani Beauty! We’re a new small business and we’re selling graphic liners (neon and pastel) which are coming very soon! Please stay tuned for more details to come and give us a follow so you don’t miss anything</p1>
                    <br>   
                    <p1>But that is not beauty. Nor is hours of life wasted, sitting in front of a mirror, carefully applying foundation to cover blemishes, eyeliner to achieve the desired shape and lipstick to give a subtle sexiness to appeal the eye.</p1> 
                    </div>

                    <div>
                    <h1>MISSION</h1>
                    <p1>Beauty is not weeks of pain after a costly surgery to fix what was naturally given; plastic cannot be substitute to something so naturally beautiful as a body gifted by parents.</p1>
                    <p1>People follow cosmetic advertisements in learning that one can achieve true beauty using makeup. Cosmetic advertisements teach that the more cosmetic products a person can wear the more beautiful a person will be. Cosmetic advertisements create an allusion of what real beauty is through lipstick, eyeliners, elongated eyelashes, eye shadows, powder puffs and other cosmetic products.</p1>
                    <p1>Cosmetic advertisements aim is to demonstrate that one is not beautiful without the use of cosmetic products. One cause of this myth is because it appears that people are at their happiest when they are wearing new mascara or are modeling the newest eyeliner. Cosmetic Advertisements portray that if people want excitement in life people should wear cosmetics.</p1>
